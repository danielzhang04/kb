## 2026-07-16 — M1 fleet planning session (interactive, Fable 5 boss)
- WORKED: research→synthesize→adversarial-verify→revise workflow pattern (3 runs, 22 Opus 4.8 agents, 613/613 turns model-verified via transcript grep). Panels caught 6 blockers incl. gh-pr-create violating the trust-anchor invariant and a standing-auth self-grant path.
- WORKED: runtime model verification = grep subagent JSONLs for "model":"claude-opus-4-8"; task .output files are zero-byte, don't use.
- DECIDED (Daniel): Gemini deferred (privacy); bot token desktop; web research fleet-wide (only approval-minting process isolated); faceless-youtube untouched (kb copy outdated — do not run cadences on it); dashboard = Option B hybrid workbench, after foundations.
- REMAINS: execute docs/plans/2026-07-16-m1-fleet-implementation.md (54 items, branch claude/m1-fleet). Stop point was deliberate — Daniel wants a fresh terminal to pick up at docs/plans/2026-07-16-m1-fleet-HANDOFF.md. Phase-0 human gates (claude.ai routine settings + carve-out commit) are the first move.
- FRICTION: ECC user-scope GateGuard hooks fire inside kb sessions (fact-forcing on Bash/Write) — retarget before fleet launch. MSYS python lacks pip/yaml; use py -3.

## 2026-07-16 — m1-fleet execution started, then rolled back by Daniel (connection issues; resume later)
- Executed plan tasks 0.3, 0.4-proposal, 1.1, 1.3 via Opus 4.8 subagents (TDD + per-task adversarial review), then Daniel stopped the run and asked for a full erase: claude/m1-fleet reset to ffa762c (design docs only), worktree removed, nothing pushed. A fresh terminal resumes from docs/plans/2026-07-16-m1-fleet-HANDOFF.md with zero built content — the handoff's "nothing executed" line is true again.
- KEEP for the rebuild (real review findings, will recur): (1) Task 1.1 — the plan's illustrative comma-join payload format has a list-vs-scalar hash collision; JSON-encode action+target in approval_payload (injective). (2) Task 1.3 — gpg VALIDSIG alone accepts revoked/expired keys; verdict must be VALIDSIG AND NOT (REVKEYSIG/EXPKEYSIG/EXPSIG), with anchored [GNUPG:] token parsing and subprocess timeouts. (3) MSYS gpg quirks on this box: agent fails under long Windows paths; gpg --import exits 2 even on success — judge by key presence in scratch home.
- Process lessons (also in auto-memory): present human gates ONE at a time at their plan position; run subagents in background so Daniel's messages reach the boss session; py -3 not python (MSYS python lacks pip/yaml); ECC GateGuard demands stated facts before first Bash/Write — present and retry.

## Grade-ledger commits must be authored by the grader identity (2026-07-19, ecc-import-w1)

### Context
- Ran the first real graded wave (5 cards, ECC Tier-1 imports). Inspectors emitted rows via record_grade; orchestrator committed the ledger under its own git identity.

### Root Cause / Core Insight
- reconcile.py's v1 trust anchor is the AUTHOR EMAIL of the oldest commit introducing each row's exact bytes (pickaxe -S, lines[-1]). Who runs record_grade is invisible; who authors the commit is everything.

### The Pattern (transferable)
- Next time I commit ledgers/grades or ledgers/activity rows, I will commit with author inspector@agents.local (or have the Inspector session commit itself) BEFORE pushing ops.
- Signal to recognize: any commit staging files under ledgers/grades/ or ledgers/activity/.
- Fix for wrong-author rows: rows must be RE-EMITTED with fresh ts (new bytes -> new pickaxe needle); amending or removing alone cannot fix the oldest-introducer.

### Related
- Wave state 2026-07-19: all 5 wave-1 cards done + graded (4x96, 1x95 PASS T2) on branch claude/ecc-import-w1 (worktree ecc-import, head 0a105c1); loop-design-check + growth-log promoted to curated (Daniel read-throughs); wave-2 cards filed blocked behind wave-1 ids 6a5c7274-{284cf0b2,99cc4601,1e97713f,9274a933,484a6b30}. PENDING: grade-row authorship re-emission (classifier blocked --author; Daniel to decide), then reconcile.py (do NOT run before the fix - it would quarantine and freeze), then Daniel merge gate + wave-2 go/no-go.
