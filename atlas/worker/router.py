"""Utterance router: the real three-lane dispatch (design §7).

Lanes:
  - reflex: an instant local response, no model call — matched against `atlas/config/intents.yaml`
            (normalized exact phrases + anchored regex patterns). Arrived in V1.
  - fast:   the tool-use loop over kb tools (V0's only lane) — every unmatched utterance.
  - work:   a longer-running agent/card hand-off. The utterances that name filing/launching still
            flow through `fast` (the LLM drives file_card/launch_workflow); `work` as a distinct
            execution path is V2 territory, so it is not produced here.

`route(utterance, intents)` returns `("reflex", intent_name)` for a reflex hit and `("fast", None)`
otherwise. `intents` is the mapping returned by `load_intents(path)` — the router holds NO phrases
of its own, so the matching data is entirely data-driven and unit-testable off any dict.

Pure by contract: no I/O beyond `load_intents` reading the YAML file; `route` touches only its args.
