"""Local wake-word listener (openwakeword 0.6.0; custom-trained "hey atlas", pretrained
"hey jarvis" as fallback).

Always-on, on-device: it reads the mic in 80 ms / 1280-sample frames at 16 kHz and never
sends audio anywhere — the only thing that leaves this module is the `on_wake()` call when
the wake score crosses threshold. Audio only leaves the PC AFTER wake, via the Deepgram STT
stream that app.py opens on the engagement transition (spec §2 Listening decision).

openwakeword facts (installed 0.6.0, verified against site-packages):
- `Model(wakeword_models=[<arg>], inference_framework="onnx")`. tflite_runtime is NOT installed
  in atlas/.venv; onnxruntime is — so onnx is the working framework.
- Each entry in `wakeword_models` is resolved per-entry (model.py L89-100): if `os.path.exists(entry)`
  it is loaded AS A FILE and keyed by its STEM `os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(entry))[0]`
  (model.py L92); otherwise it is treated as a pretrained NAME, matched via `name.replace(" ", "_")`
  against the shipped catalog and keyed by that bare name (model.py L95-100).
- So a custom-trained model → pass the full path `config/hey_atlas.onnx`, predict-key = `hey_atlas`.
  A pretrained model → pass the bare name `hey_jarvis`, predict-key = `hey_jarvis`. Because we name
  the custom file `<wake_model>.onnx`, the stem == the configured name in both cases; `load_model()`
  returns the exact key anyway so a rename can never silently break the score lookup in `listen()`.
- `model.predict(frame)` -> dict keyed as above for single-output wake models (model.py L313-314),
  e.g. {"hey_atlas": 0.91}. Trigger at > 0.5.
- Feature models (melspectrogram.onnx + embedding_model.onnx) are shared by ALL wake models and
  loaded by the preprocessor from the default cache (utils.py L70-73). A path-loaded custom model
  needs ONLY those two — no pretrained download. Pretrained names additionally need `<name>_v0.1.onnx`.
  `ensure_models()` fetches whatever is missing via openwakeword.utils.download_models (which always
  grabs the feature models, and skips any name it can't match in the catalog — utils.py L662-668).
