"""Voice-clean text (conversation-rules design §2). Streaming-safe by construction for
SINGLE-character markers: they are removed per-chunk at character level (a split "**" still dies);
line-anchored headers, list markers, and links are best-effort within a chunk. Chunks are never
.strip()ped — a single leading/trailing space is the word boundary between streamed segments.

COUPLING NOTE (review 2026-07-22): the multi-char [quiet] marker is NOT independently
streaming-safe — a chunk split mid-marker ("[", "quiet]") would leak audible fragments. Today
livekit's default `filter_markdown` transform runs UPSTREAM of tts_node and buffers any unclosed
"[" until the bracket closes, so the marker always arrives contiguous (verified against installed
livekit-agents 1.6.6: generation.py:355 + filters.py has_incomplete_pattern). If
`tts_text_transforms` is ever customized/emptied, or that upstream bracket-buffering changes on
upgrade, add a bracket-span buffer to our tts_node override — test_split_quiet_marker_limitation
documents the dependency."""
