/**
 * Always-on PM2 supervision for the Atlas desk voice worker.
 *
 * `run-worker.js` is the Windows-safe shim that starts the Atlas virtualenv's
 * `python.exe -m worker.app console`, forwards stop signals, and mirrors the
 * worker's exit status so PM2 can supervise it.
 *
 * CREDENTIAL RULE: this committed file contains no environment values or
 * secrets. Atlas reads its user-private runtime configuration through the
 * existing worker path; do not add credentials here.
