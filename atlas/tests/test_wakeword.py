"""WakeGate — the ghost-wake debounce (2026-08-12).

The gate is the pure decision seam of worker/wakeword.py's listen() loop: one score per 80ms
frame in, "wake"/"spike"/None out. These tests pin the contract that killed the desk's
"Hey boss ... okay sleeping" every-two-minutes cycle: single-frame threshold crossings must
NOT wake Atlas, sustained crossings must, and one phrase fires exactly one wake.
