"""Reflex lane (design §7, Task 10): router.load_intents + router.route.

Pure unit tests — no audio, no LLM, no I/O beyond reading the shipped intents.yaml. The matching
data lives ONLY in atlas/config/intents.yaml; the router hardcodes nothing (proved by the
custom-intents and pattern tests, which drive route() off dicts the router has never seen).
